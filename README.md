# MultiAgentDQRNForDifferentTrafficDemands

## Introduction:


## Research Questions:

* How does the Transfer Planning approach combined with the Max-Plus or Brute Coordination algorithm perform when compared to Individual Coordination?
This can studied by training agents for single as well as multiple traffic intersections. The multiple traffic intersections can be trained for a small source problem which then can be extended to a bigger problem by using Transfer Planning. Finally, comparison can be done on the basis of the
reward function and average travel time.

* How does the TLC agent perform for different traffic demands?
Again the above approach can be followed, but first the agents need to be trained for different traffic congestion scenarios. In order to define congestion, various literature can be studied and conclusions can be drawn on how to choose low, medium or high traffic congestion.

* How does the different coordination algorithms perform computationally in case of Traffic Light-Control problem?
This can be studied by measuring the time complexity and the actual runtime for the different algorithms as the number of intersections increase. There can be several factors influencing the performance as the number of agents are scaled up.
